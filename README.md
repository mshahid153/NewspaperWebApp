Developed a news application using React, incorporating various features to enhance user experience and accessibility.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Design:** Utilized light colors to reduce strain on the eyes, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for users, especially during prolonged use.

- **E-Paper Feature:** Integrated an e-paper feature to simulate the experience of reading a physical newspaper. This feature enhances user engagement and provides a nostalgic touch to the digital news consumption experience.
